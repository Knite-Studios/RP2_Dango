# 🕹️ Dango: The Atari-style Puzzler 🐕
Imagine a cute pup, stuck in an 8-bit universe, where every move counts and the gameplay is as old-school as it gets. That's Dango for ya! It’s a throwback to the golden age of Atari, with all the delightful restrictions that come with it.

## Simple, But Not Really...
2 inputs. That's all Dango has. A joystick to weave through the digital realm and a single button to interact with it. Sounds easy, right? Well, think again! Dango faces movement puzzles that’ll make you scratch your head, chuckle, and probably shout, "Just one more go!"

## Why Dango?
Because who doesn’t love challenges? Especially when they're wrapped up in pixelated graphics and chiptune beats. Plus, it's always fun to see a digital doggie get out of tight spots (or get into them, depending on your gaming skills).

## Dive in, have fun, and let's take a trip down nostalgia lane with Dango!
